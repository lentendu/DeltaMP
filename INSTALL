Dependencies:
DeltaMP is intend to be used on a HPC with a job scheduler (i.e. batch-queueing system). DeltaMP currently support two job schedulers:
*  SLURM (https://slurm.schedmd.com)
*  Oracle Grid Engine (http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/oem/grid-engine-166852.html) and its derivatives (e.g. Open Grid Scheduler, http://gridscheduler.sourceforge.net ; Univa Grid Engine, http://www.univa.com/products)

DeltaMP require all of the following softwares to be installed:
*  OBITools (https://git.metabarcoding.org/obitools/obitools)
*  MOTHUR (http://www.mothur.org)
*  cutadapt (https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/)
*  biom-format (http://biom-format.org)
*  gnu parallel (http://savannah.gnu.org/projects/parallel)
*  R (https://cran.r-project.org/)
*  Ghostscript (https://www.ghostscript.com/)
*  WebLogo (https://github.com/WebLogo/weblogo)
*  archive-sum (https://github.com/idiv-biodiversity/archive-sum)

Depending on the workflows, DeltaMP could need the following softwares:
1. for using remote libraries on short read archives:
*  SRA toolkit (https://github.com/ncbi/sra-tools)
2. for Illumina pair-ending and pre-clustering:
*  PANDAseq (https://github.com/neufeld/pandaseq)
*  cd-hit-454 (as part of cd-hit http://weizhongli-lab.org/cd-hit/)
3. 454 denoising and demultiplexing:
*  FlowClus (https://github.com/jsh58/FlowClus)
*  QIIME (http://qiime.org)
4. OTU clustering:
*  CD-HIT (http://weizhongli-lab.org/cd-hit/)
*  swarm (https://github.com/torognes/swarm)
*  MCL (http://micans.org/mcl) and sumatra (https://git.metabarcoding.org/obitools/sumatra)
*  sumaclust (https://git.metabarcoding.org/obitools/sumaclust) and sumatra (https://git.metabarcoding.org/obitools/sumatra)
*  vsearch (https://github.com/torognes/vsearch)

All this dependencies need to be available through the $PATH variable or need to be loaded by the DeltaMP module file (see below 4.b, 4.c and 6.)


Installation informations:

1. change/dive to installation directory

2. clone git repository with:
    git clone git@gitlab.com:lentendu/DeltaMP.git
   
    or clone only the desired branch with:
    git clone -b BRANCH-NAME --single-branch git@gitlab.com:lentendu/DeltaMP.git

3. cd to the newly create directory DeltaMP

4. edit the configuration file config.txt, with respecting the format VARIABLE_NAME[Tab]VARIABLE_VALUE
    a. BATCH: batch queueing system, either 'GridEngine' or 'Slurm'
    b. MODULES_TO_BE_LOADED: semi-column separated list of dependency modules to be loaded by the DeltaMP module

5. to build DeltaMP, a simple make is enough:
    make
If you want to modify the configuration informations from config.txt and re-build, first clean the previously built files and directories with:
    make clean

6. A modulefiles directory will be created inside the DeltaMP directory.
To load the DeltaMP/VERSION module you have two options:
	a. either add the DeltaMP/modulefiles directory to your MODULEPATH variable by adding at the end of your ~/.bashrc or ~/bash_profile file the following line :
    export MODULEPATH=/FULL/PATH/TO/DeltaMP/modulefiles:$MODULEPATH
with /FULL/PATH/TO/ being the full path to your DeltaMP directory
	b. or copy the DeltaMP/modulefiles/DeltaMP directory to your prefered modulefiles directory which is already in your MODULEPATH (or copy only the module file named after the current version number if you already have a DeltaMP directory in your prefered modulefiles directory)

7. IF you choos 6.a., you first need to reload your bash configurations with to allow the detection of the newly set MODULEPATH variable:
    source ~/.bashrc
or
    source ~/.bash_profile

8. Finally, you can load the DeltaMP module with:
    module load DeltaMP/VERSION
with VERSION being the installed version number
