# DeltaMP installation informations


1. change/dive to installation directory


2. retrieve DeltaMP
	a. either by downloading the last release:
		wget https://github.com/lentendu/DeltaMP/archive/refs/tags/v0.6.tar.gz && tar xzvf DeltaMP-0.6.tar.gz
	
	b. alternatively, by cloning the development version:
		git clone https://github.com/lentendu/DeltaMP.git DeltaMP-0.6


3. cd to the newly created directory:
	cd DeltaMP-0.6


4. edit the TAB-separated configuration file config.txt, by keeping the unmodified variable name on the first column and by modifying the second column values fitting your queueing system and HPC:
	a. BATCH_QUEUE: name of the batch queuing system, either 'GridEngine' or 'Slurm'
	
	b. MODULE_NAME: name of the module used to create the modulefile name and directory name (default is "DeltaMP/0.5")
	
	c. MODULEFILES_DIR: path of the modulefiles directory, either full or relative to the installation directory (default is "modulefiles")
	
	d. MODULES_TO_BE_LOADED: semi-column separated list of dependency modules to be loaded by the DeltaMP module.
	
	e. JOB_RUNTIME: job runtime for all jobs (advised minimum: 1 day)
	
	f. MAX_MEMORY_FOR_SERIAL: maximum memory request for serial jobs (advised minimum: 3-4G)
		
	g. MAX_MEMORY_FOR_PARALLEL: maximum memory request for MP parallel jobs (advised minimum: 3-4G per CPU); on Slurm this is the per node memory, while on GridEngine this is the per CPU memory request. So, on GridEngine MAX_MEMORY_FOR_PARALLEL * MAX_CPU_PER_NODES should not be higher than the maximum amount of memory available on one standard node.
	
	h. MAX_ARRAY_MEMORY_FOR_SERIAL: maximum memory request for array jobs (advised minimum: 3-4G)
	
	i. MAX_ARRAY_MEMORY_FOR_PARALLEL: maximum memory request for MP parallel jobs (advised minimum: 5-8G per CPU)
	
	j. MAX_HIGH_MEM_MEMORY_FOR_SERIAL: maximum memory request for serial jobs with high-memory needs (advised minimum: 32G).
	
	k. MAX_HIGH_MEM_MEMORY_FOR_PARALLEL: maximum memory request for MP parallel jobs with high-memory needs (advised minimum: 8G per CPU) ; on Slurm this is the per node memory, while on GridEngine this is the per CPU memory request. So, on GridEngine MAX_HIGH_MEM_MEMORY_FOR_PARALLEL * MAX_HIGH_MEM_CPU_PER_NODES should not be higher than the maximum amount of memory available on one high-memory node.
	
	l. MAX_CPU_PER_NODES: the number of CPUs on one standard node for MP parallel jobs (advised: all CPUs from most abundant type of node)
	
	m. MAX_ARRAY_CPU_PER_NODES: the number of CPUs on one standard node for MP parallel array jobs (advised: 25 to 50 % of CPUs from most abundant type of node)
	
	n. MAX_HIGH_MEM_CPU_PER_NODES: the number of CPUs on one high-memory node for MP parallel jobs (advised maximum: 16)
	
	o. QUEUE_PARTITION_STANDARD: the name of the partition(s) or queue(s) to run standard jobs; comma separated list if more than one; this variable is optional
	
	p. QUEUE_PARTITION_HIGHMEM: the name of the partition(s) or queue(s) to run high-memory jobs; comma separated list if more than one; this variable is optional


5. to build DeltaMP, a simple make is enough:
		make

	If you want to modify the configuration informations from config.txt and re-build, first clean the previously built files and directories with:
		make clean


6. A modulefiles directory will be created inside the DeltaMP directory. To load the DeltaMP/0.5 module you have two options:
	a. either add the DeltaMP/modulefiles directory to your MODULEPATH variable by adding at the end of your ~/.bashrc or ~/.bash_profile file the following line :
		export MODULEPATH=/FULL/PATH/TO/DeltaMP/modulefiles:$MODULEPATH
	with /FULL/PATH/TO/ being the full path to your DeltaMP directory
	
	b. or copy the DeltaMP/modulefiles/DeltaMP directory to your preferred modulefiles directory which is already in your MODULEPATH (or copy only the modulefile "0.5" if you already have a DeltaMP directory in your preferred modulefiles directory)


7. If you choose 6.a., you first need to reload your bash configurations to allow the detection of the newly set MODULEPATH variable:
	source ~/.bashrc
or
    source ~/.bash_profile


8. Finally, you can load the DeltaMP module with:
    module load DeltaMP/0.5
